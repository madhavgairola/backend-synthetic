"${concernOrRecommendation}"

Your task is to generate a tangible, highly actionable "Asset" that solves this specific issue.
If it's a pricing concern, generate a 3-tier pricing strategy and the exact landing page copy.
If it's a feature recommendation, generate a product spec or user story for that feature.
If it's a trust issue, generate exact copy for a "Trust & Safety" page or guarantees.

Return ONLY the Markdown content for the asset. Do not include any meta-commentary like "Here is the asset." Make it look highly professional using Markdown formatting, headers, tables, and bold text where appropriate.`;
